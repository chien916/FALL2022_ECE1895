All the source code (both c++ and qml) and resource files are in the root directory, so it is already very easy to navigate.

./*.ttf -> Required Font Files
./*.qml -> QML Interface Declaration Files
./qml.qrc -> Qt Resource Management Configuration
./server.hpp -> Business Logic Implementations - MyServer class
./gmouse.pro -> QMake Configuration File
./qtquickcontrols2.conf -> QtQuick Control Styling Configuration
./main.cpp -> C++ Program Entry
./qmldir -> QML Singleton Configuration File
